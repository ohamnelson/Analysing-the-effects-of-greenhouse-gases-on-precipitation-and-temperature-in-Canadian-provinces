# Analysing-the-effects-of-greenhouse-gases-on-precipitation-and-temperature-in-Canadian-provinces
This project was my first project using SQL. For this project i was focused on querying data from multiple tables.
The aim of the project was to see the trends in greenhouse gas emmision in Canadian provinces, and its effects on precipitation and temperature.
The four data sets used in this project can be found in the reference section of the ipynb.
